1.As I see from the list.h file, it uses a lot of of pointers to construcut the method. I want to know does the pointer follows the rule of call by reference or it can be called by value?

2.On the list.cpp file, I found out when the licked list tried to call certain function uses a lot "->" operator which is different from Java language which uses "xx.function()". I wonder if this is something sepcial for linked-list or pointer.
